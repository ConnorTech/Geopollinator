Geopollinator
=============

##Introduction
**Geopollinator** is a web based application that will help teach Geopolitics students the countries that they need to learn. This program will ease the pain that is learning random geographical facts. The program will be tailored to include only the countries that will be found on the Geopolitics. This design spec will provide more detailed information on:
*Client side programming language
*Data storage requirements and tool choices
*Software test strategy
*Bug tracking strategy
*Software deployment instructions

##Client Side Programming Language
The languages we are working with are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These will all be run on the client’s web browser. The server we are running off of does not require the client to store data or otherwise communicate with the user. So the only requirements are that the client’s web browser can understand javascript, HTML, and CSS.

##Data Storage Requirements
We are planning on having the program have an option to save custom country study lists as cookies on the user’s browsers. Since this is not an extremely important tool it’s okay if the user does not always have access to their lists.

##Software Test Strategy
We will have humans do the testing. They will be testing general functionality, does the thing work, do you understand how to use it. Testing interface. Random combinations. What does it take for you to break it. Questions like that.

##Bug Tracking Strategy
Javascript is not able to be debugged in eclipse so in order to test the debugging capabilities of the program we are going to have to use google chrome to debug the software.

##Software Deployment Instructions
We are going to place the software on netdenizen.com. This will allow us to get it out to the general public so long as they have the link to the website.
